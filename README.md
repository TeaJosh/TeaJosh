# 👋 Hi, I'm Tejosh Rana

I'm an aspiring data analyst with hands-on experience in Python and R, currently expanding my skills across the full data analysis workflow. I’m learning how to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data using the tools and techniques commonly used in real-world analytics. My focus is on strengthening my foundations in Excel, SQL, descriptive statistics, data manipulation, and clear insight communication.

## 📘 What I’m Learning Right Now

* Excel fundamentals: key formulas, pivot tables, lookups, date and text functions
* SQL basics: querying, filtering, joining, aggregations
* Data concepts: collection, exploration, cleanup, reporting, and visualization
* Descriptive statistics: distributions, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
* Data visualization principles and charting best practices
* Python/R libraries for data manipulation (Pandas, dplyr) and visualization (Matplotlib, ggplot2)

## 🛠️ Skills I’m Actively Developing

* Cleaning and preparing datasets (handling missing values, formatting issues, duplicates)
* Working with CSV files, APIs, and basic web scraping
* Understanding distributions and summarizing data
* Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and simple regression
* Creating effective charts and dashboards
* Automating basic data tasks using Python or R

## 📈 Tools and Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **R** (dplyr, ggplot2)
* **Excel**
* **SQL**
* **Power BI / Tableau** (learning)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* Git & version control
